\f0\fs24 \cf0 1. Compute and plot the Binomial(n,p) probability distribution. Play around with n, p and see how the plot changes.\
2. Compute and plot the Poisson(lambda) probability distribution. Play around with lambda and see how the plot changes.\
3. Show graphically that as simultaneously n tends to infinity and p tends to zero, with n times p = constant say lambda, the Binomial(n,p) is approximated by Poisson(lambda).\

4. Input a portfolio of n = 100 IDENTICAL assets subject to default risk. Each asset has probability of default = p = 0.3. Assume credit events across the assets in the portfolio are independent. Compute a candidate expected portfolio loss for 1 trial by hand simulation. This means generate a random credit event for each asset independently, then add losses for all assets in the portfolio to get get portfolio loss.\
5. In above task, compute portfolio loss by\'a0 simulating\'a0 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 trials keeping the number of assets n=100 as constant. What does it converge to as number of trials increases?\
6. In above task, what does the limiting probability distribution of the portfolio loss look like?\
7. For the same exercise, construct a portfolio loss distribution by simulation when asset values are identical but losses are not, so for instance assume loss given default either 30%, 60%, 80% or 100% of the asset value and each of these four possibilities is equally likely. \
