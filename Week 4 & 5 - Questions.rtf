\f0\fs24 \cf0 1. Extend the task 5 of Week 3 to three periods using arrays and for loops. Navigate along the tree to move backwards in time computing option prices at each stage until you reach time zero and hence solve for the current option price. Show both stock and option price trees on the spreadsheet.\
2. Extend the above task 1 to n periods, where n is determined by the user and the arrays are dynamic (use Redim command). For a given maturity say 1 year, use smaller and smaller time steps (larger and larger n) and show that the option price converges.}
